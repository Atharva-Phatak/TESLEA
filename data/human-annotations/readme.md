In this study, three-domain experts judge the quality of generated text based on the factors

- Adequacy
- Informativeness
- Coherence
- Factuality
- Fluency

The evaluators rate the text on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, simplified test data was generated using TESLEA, and then 51 generated texts are randomly selected, creating three subsets containing 17 paragraphs each. Every evaluator is shown two subsets, i.e., a total of 34 complex-simple TESLEA generated paragraphs.

The included CSV files contain average likert scores for each rater after scaling, as mentioned each evaluator is shown two subsets hence there are overlaps between valuations which is then scaled.
The human evaluations were done via the help of the google forms. Here is a sample [google form](https://forms.gle/aCQHvQK9fRwNu5kp7).

We hope this data will help to further research. We are also releasing the set of sentences used for this study.

The training data is converted to CSV. Original data can be found [here](https://github.com/AshOlogn/Paragraph-level-Simplification-of-Medical-Texts)
